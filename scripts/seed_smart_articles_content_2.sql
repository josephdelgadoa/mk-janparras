    '# Civil Wedding in Puerto Vallarta: Legal Requirements

A "Civil Ceremony" is the only type of wedding that is legally recognized worldwide. If you want your Mexican marriage certificate to be valid back home, this is the path.

## The Requirements

1.  **Valid Passports**: For both bride and groom.
2.  **Tourist Cards (FMM)**: The paper you get when entering the country.
3.  **Blood Tests**: Must be done **in Mexico** within 14 days of the wedding. They test for HIV, Syphilis, and Blood Type.
4.  **4 Witnesses**: They also need ID.
5.  **Health Certificate**: Issued by a local doctor after the blood test.

## The Process

*   **Arrive Early**: You typically need to be in PV 3-4 business days before the wedding to complete the blood work and paperwork.
*   **The Ceremony**: Conducted by a Civil Registry Official (Judge). It is in Spanish. You will need a translator if you don''t speak Spanish.
*   **The Vows**: The legal code includes specific (and sometimes old-fashioned) readings about the duties of spouses.

## Tips

*   **Do the Legal Part at Home**: Many couples get legally married at their local courthouse in the US/Canada before travelling. This allows them to have a "Symbolic Ceremony" in PV, skipping the blood tests and paperwork.
*   **Budget**: Legal fees and blood tests can add $600-$1000 to your budget.

## FAQs

### Can I change the judge''s script?
No, the legal text is mandatory. However, you can write your own personal vows to say after the legal portion.

### How long does it take to get the certificate?
You usually get a copy immediately, but the apostilled version (for international use) can take weeks to mail.',

    '# How to Plan a Stunning Puerto Vallarta Wedding on a Budget

Puerto Vallarta is one of the most affordable destination wedding locations, but costs can creep up. Here is how to keep them down.

## 1. Choose the "Low" Season
Late October or May are "shoulder season" months. The weather is decent, but resort and venue prices drop significantly compared to January-March.

## 2. Think Tacos & Tequila
Skip the filet mignon. Authentic Mexican taco stations are not only cheaper but often more memorable for guests. A high-end taco buffet is a crowd pleaser.

## 3. Local Flowers
Imported peonies will cost a fortune. Use local tropical blooms like Orchids, Ginger Torches, and Bougainvillea. They are vibrant, sturdy in the heat, and affordable.

## 4. Skip the Champagne Toast
Sparkling wine or a creative "Mezcal Toast" is much more budget-friendly and culturally relevant.

## 5. Non-Beach Venues
Beachfront premiums are real. Consider a villa in the hills or a garden venue slightly inland. The views are often better from above!

## FAQs

### What is the average cost of a wedding in PV?
For 50 guests, a moderate budget is around $10,000 - $15,000 USD, excluding travel.

### Is it cheaper to do a resort wedding?
Often yes, package deals can be significantly cheaper than hiring a private venue + all vendors separately.',

    '# Micro-Weddings & Elopements in Puerto Vallarta

Gigantic weddings aren''t for everyone. A micro-wedding or elopement allows you to splurge on quality over quantity.

## Why PV is Perfect for Elopements
*   **Romantic corners**: Countless hidden coves and private terrace restaurants.
*   **Luxury access**: With fewer guests, you can afford that 5-star dinner or private yacht charter.

## Elopement Itinerary Idea
*   **Morning**: Couples massage at the resort.
*   **Noon**: Relax by the pool.
*   **5:00 PM**: Private ceremony on a secluded beach (like Playa Las Gemelas).
*   **7:00 PM**: Private romantic dinner on a cliffside terrace.

## Top Venues for Small Groups
1.  **Le Kliff**: Dramatic ocean views, perfect for small tables.
2.  **Hacienda San Angel**: Old-world charm, intimate chapel.
3.  **Private Yacht**: Get married at sea!

## FAQs

### Do I need a witness for an elopement?
For a legal wedding, yes (4 witnesses). For a symbolic one, no just the officiant.

### Can I book a photographer for just 1 hour?
Yes, many photographers offer specific "elopement packages" covering just the ceremony and portraits.',

    '# Rain Plan Done Right: PV Weather Guide

Puerto Vallarta is in the tropics. "Rainy Season" runs from June to mid-October. It doesn''t rain all day, but evening showers are common.

## The Strategy
If you marry in summer/early autumn, you **must** have a covered option. Not a "maybe." A "must."

## Palapas are Your Friend
Many venues feature giant Palapas (thatched roofs). They are open-air but covered. This is the perfect compromise—you feel the breeze but stay dry.

## Tenting
Clear tents with string lights look magical. They reflect the rain and create a cozy atmosphere. Ensure your venue has space for a tent.

## Timing
Summer storms usually hit in the late afternoon / early evening (5 PM - 8 PM). Consider a morning ceremony or a later dinner. The storms pass quickly and leave cooler air behind.

## FAQs

### Does it rain in winter?
Rarely. November to May is very dry.

### Is a tent expensive?
It can be. Expect to pay $1,000 - $3,000 depending on size and flooring.',

    '# Wedding Packages vs. Custom Planning

## The Resort Package
**Best for**: Couples who want simplicity and budget control.
*   **Pros**: One price, one contact, low stress.
*   **Cons**: Limited decor choices, often "cookie-cutter" feel, private events cost extra.

## Custom Planning (Private Venue)
**Best for**: Couples with a specific vision who want privacy.
*   **Pros**: Total privacy (no strangers in swimsuits in background), unique food, stay up late (no resort noise rules).
*   **Cons**: More decisions to make, usually higher cost.

## The Verdict
If you have < 30 guests, a custom villa wedding is often comparable in price to a resort and offer superior privacy. For > 100 guests, resorts offer economies of scale that are hard to beat.

## FAQs

### Can I mix and match?
Some resorts allow "Outside Vendor" passes so you can bring your own photographer or florist to a package wedding.',

    '# Symbolic vs. Civil Weddings in Mexico

## The Civil Wedding (Legal)
As discussed, this involves a judge, blood tests, and government paperwork. The ceremony is in Spanish and follows a legal script.

## The Symbolic Wedding (Spiritual)
This looks exactly like a wedding but has no legal weight.
*   **Officiant**: Can be a minister, shaman, friend, or family member.
*   **Script**: Totally 100% up to you. Write your own vows, include readings, etc.
*   **Language**: English (or whatever you speak).
*   **Paperwork**: None.

## Why Choose Symbolic?
It allows you to focus on the ceremony and emotion without the bureaucracy. You get legally married at your local courthouse the week before you fly out. Nobody needs to know the difference!

## FAQs

### Does a symbolic wedding look "fake"?
Not at all. It looks identical to a legal one. The guests usually don''t know unless you tell them.',

A full live band is expensive ($3k+). A DJ is cheaper ($1k). A DJ with a live Saxophone player ($1.5k) gives you the live energy feeling for half the price of a band.

## 3. Repurpose Decor
Move the ceremony arch flowers to the sweetheart table. Move the aisle lanterns to the dance floor perimeter.

## 4. Digital Invites
Save hundreds on printing and postage. Use a chic website (like Minted or Zola) for RSVPs.
